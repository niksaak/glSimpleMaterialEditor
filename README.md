# glSimpleMaterialEditor

It's just a simple material editor which was created during/for the GLSL language learning.

## Done:
 - Most simple shaders imitating fixed pipeline. GLSL version is 1.2 so they're kinda poo, though.

## ToDo:
 - Add more input callback (mouse, ...)
 - Swith to the  programmable pipeline (the first shaders are going to be added since that)
 - Add some preview mesh for the meterial testing
 - Start implementing physically base material using shaders
